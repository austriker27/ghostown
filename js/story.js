// DOGGO pre-encounter
var story1 = ['In the not-too-distant future, mankind succumbs to the daunting pressures of nuclear conflict, and the Earth is a wasteland.'];

var story3 = ['For most GHOSTS, GhosTown is juuuuuust perfect: it’s boring, uneventful, filled with hipsters, and it rains. A lot... But for a handful of ghosts, this lifeless non-existence is simply not enough.'];
var story4 = ['Three GHOSTS want to know if there is LIFE (or perhaps \'death\') outside of GhosTown! They have questions that need answering! What lies beyond the borders of this afterlife? What hidden force keeps the dead from leaving GhosTown?'];

// HIPSTER pre-encounter
var storyHipster1 = ['As you continue your aimless wandering, you begin to wonder: what is even beyond the borders of GhosTown? How come nobody has ever been outside this place and come back to tell the tale? Nobody ever talks about these things. What’s the deal with that?'];
var storyHipster2 = ['With just enough time to watch it go down but not enough time to do anything about it, a Hipster Ghost, waist-deep into his cellular ghost-phone, bumps RIGHT INTO YOU!'];

var storyGhostly4 = ['Ghostly: “You are not going ANYWHERE! Haaahahahaha!!”'];

var storyGho11 = ['You reach your little ghostie-arm out and make contact with the figure, who is also reaching out their little arm to you. You make contact, but it’s more like touching your left arm to your right arm, only you apparently absorb into each other.'];
